Q1. What is meant by the term AIOps, & then contrast it with MLOps.

Ans.
AIOps, (for artificial intelligence for IT operations) is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance IT operations. Specifically, AIOps uses big data, analytics, and machine learning capabilities to do the following:

1. Collect and aggregate the huge and ever-increasing volumes of operations data generated by multiple IT infrastructure components, applications, and performance-monitoring tools.

2. Intelligently sift ‘signals’ out of the ‘noise’ to identify significant events and patterns related to system performance and availability issues.

3. Diagnose root causes and report them to IT for rapid response and remediation—or, in some cases, automatically resolve these issues without human intervention.

Difference between AIOps and MLOps:

AIOps is about increased efficiency in IT operations, achieved by automating incident/management  diagnostics and intelligently finding the root cause through machine learning. By sifting through the noise generated by monitoring systems and reducing the false positives, these solutions present technical teams with high quality information that is easy to understand, so that they can get to work on a resolution.

MLOps, on the other hand, focuses on creating an automated pipeline for bringing machine learning models into production. It looks to overcome the disconnect between data science or data ops teams and infrastructure teams, to get models into production faster and more often. Importantly – and in contrast to AIOps – MLOps doesn’t directly refer to a machine learning capability per se, with algorithms processing data. Rather, it’s a way to manage and streamline the building, deployment and maintenance of those algorithms.

AIOps is all about supporting and reacting to its issues in real-time and providing analytics to your operations teams. These functions include performance monitoring, event analysis, correlation, and IT automation. According to Gartner, AIOps combines big data and machine learning to automate IT operations processes. Therefore, the end goal of AIOps is to automatically spot issues in day-to-day IT operations and proactively react to them using Artificial Intelligence.

MLOps, on the other hand, focuses on managing training and testing data that is needed to create machine learning models effectively. It is all about monitoring and management of ML models. It focuses on the Machine Learning operationalization pipeline.

Q2. Interpretable Machine Learning is another concept that has attracted lot of attention recently & is promoted by most of the MLOps frameworks. Explain what it means for a linear regression model to be interpretable.

Ans.
Interpret means to explain or to present in understandable terms. In the context of ML systems, interpretability is the ability to explain or to present in understandable terms to a human. In a way, we capture the world by collecting raw data and use that data to make further predictions. Essentially, Interpretability is just another layer on the model that helps humans to understand the process.

Some of the benefits that interpretability brings along are:
Reliability
Debugging
Informing feature engineering
Directing future data collection
Informing human decision-making
Building Trust

1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model.

2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model.

3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation.

4. Standardization (z-transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size.

5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects.

Q3. What is AutoML? How is it related to MLOps? create a list of 3-5 tools used for AutoML.

Ans.
Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of applying machine learning (ML) models to real-world problems using automation. More specifically, it automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning models. Automating the machine learning process makes it more user-friendly and often provides faster, more accurate outputs than hand-coded algorithms.
List Of Tasks AutoML Can Perform :
1. Pass The Information To AutoML And It Should Tell Us The Relationship Between Each Variable And The Target Variable.
2. Feature Engineering And Feature Selection
3. Model Selection: Choosing The Model That Works Best For Your Problem, Which Is Already There In All The AutoML Platforms.
4. Data Formatting Is Very Difficult, But It Also Converts Data Frames To A Sparse Matrix Like One Encoding

Just like the way ML has evolved from research to applied business solutions,we must enhance the maturity of its processes of operation. Hence, that’s why we have AutoML in place to reduce the workloads of doing menial or tedious tasks by Data Scientists, which is undoubtedly time-consuming as the size of the data increases. Just like we have MLOps in place to monitor the life cycle of ML models. 

Some AutoML tools that are being used in industries are H2O, TPOT, Google’s AutoML, DataRobot, Amazon SageMaker, AutoKeras, And AutoSklearn.
